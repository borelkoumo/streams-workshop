## 02.1 What is a Readable stream

A readable stream represents a source from which data is consumed. In a way, you can see Readable streams as an abstraction to consume some input.

Some common examples of Readable streams are the following:

- Read a file from the filesystem: `fs.createReadStream`
- Command line standard input: `process.stdin`
- An HTTP response (received by a client)
- An HTTP request (received by a server)
- AWS S3 `GetObject` (`data` field)

Readable streams support two modes for data consumption: **flowing** and **paused** (or **non-flowing**) mode.


## 02.2 Flowing mode

When using flowing mode, the data is read from source automatically and chunks are emitted as soon as they are available.

![Readable streams in flowing mode](./images/flowing-mode.gif)

- A Readable stream instance is automatically switched to flowing mode as soon as a listener for the `data` event is attached.
- At that point, every single time there's some data available a `data` event is emitted.
- When no more data is available, the `end` event is emitted.

In this example, we use flowing mode to consume data from a file and count the number of emojis:

```javascript
// count-emoji-flowing.js

import { createReadStream } from 'fs'
import emoji from 'emoji' // from npm

const file = createReadStream(process.argv[2], { encoding: 'utf-8' })
let counter = 0

file.on('data', chunk => {
  for (const char of chunk.toString('utf8')) {
    if (emoji.EMOJI_MAP[char]) {
      counter++
    }
  }
})

file.on('end', () => console.log(`Found ${counter} emojis`))
file.on('error', err => console.error(`Error reading file: ${err}`))
```

## 02.3 Paused mode

When using paused mode on a Readable stream, a consumer does not receive chunks, but instead, it has to call the `read` method explicitly to read chunks of data from the stream. The stream emits a `readable` event to signal that new data is available and that `read()` should be called to read the data.

![Readable streams in paused mode](./images/paused-mode.gif)

With this approach the data is not automatically pushed to the consumer, but only a signal that the data is available is sent. It is up to the consumer to call `read()` to get the data currently stored in the stream internal buffer. If there's no more data in the internal buffer a call to `read()` will return `null`. Also in this mode, once all the data has been read, `end` is emitted.

Let's see how to rewrite the previous example in paused mode:

```javascript
// count-emoji-paused.js

import { createReadStream } from 'fs'
import emoji from 'emoji' // from npm

const file = createReadStream(process.argv[2], { encoding: 'utf-8' })
let counter = 0

file.on('readable', () => {
  let chunk
  while ((chunk = file.read()) !== null) {
    for (const char of chunk.toString('utf8')) {
      if (emoji.EMOJI_MAP[char]) {
        counter++
      }
    }
  }
})

file.on('end', () => console.log(`Found ${counter} emojis`))
file.on('error', err => console.error(`Error reading file: ${err}`))
```

> **‚úèÔ∏è Tip**
>
> When you call `readable.read(numBytes)` you can optionally pass an argument indicating how many bytes you would like to read. This can be useful when
> dealing with streaming binary protocols.
> 
> ```javascript
> const myFloat = readable.read(4).readFloatBE()
> ```
> 
> In this example we are reading 4 bytes from the stream. This will return the bytes in a `Buffer`. We can then read the data as a 32-bit, big-endian float using the `readFloatBE`() method of the `Buffer` class.
> 
> Keep in mind that you are not guaranteed to have 4 bytes ready to be consumed (there might be fewer bytes in the readable buffer or the stream might
> have terminated earlier), so in production code, make sure to check the lenght of the buffer being returned to make sure you got enough bytes. 


## 02.4 Mode switch conditions

These conditions will help you to understand better how Readable streams are initialized and which mode is being used:

- Readable streams are created in **paused** mode
- Paused streams can be switched to **flowing** mode with:
  - `stream.on('data', () => {})`
  - `stream.resume()`
  - `stream.pipe()`
- Flowing streams can switch back to **paused** with:
  - `stream.pause()`
  - `stream.unpipe()` on all attached streams

Don't worry too much about `.pipe` for now as we will explore that later.

Modes are just a convention to consume data, both are substantially equivalent and you might prefer either one or another. My advice is to pick one and stay consistent, but also not to mix the two modes while consuming from a given stream.

If you want another view on **flowing** VS **paused** mode:

 - *Push* (flowing) VS *Pull* (paused) mental models
 - Flowing is slightly simpler to use (less verbose)
 - Paused mode gives you more control on how and when data is consumed from the source (might be good when it's expensive to read data from a source)


## 02.5 Readable streams are async iterators

Readable streams are async iterators (since Node.js version 10), so we can consume data from a readable stream with the `for await of` syntax:

```javascript
async function consumeStreamData(stream) {
  for await (let chunk of stream) {
    console.log(chunk)
  }
}
```

With this in mind we can rewrite our previous example as follows:

```javascript
// count-emoji-async-iterator.js

import { createReadStream } from 'fs'
import emoji from 'emoji' // from npm

async function main () {
  const file = createReadStream(process.argv[2], { encoding: 'utf-8' })
  let counter = 0

  for await (const chunk of file) {
    for (const char of chunk.toString('utf8')) {
      if (emoji.EMOJI_MAP[char]) {
        counter++
      }
    }
  }

  console.log(`Found ${counter} emojis`)
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err)
  process.exit(1)
})
```
